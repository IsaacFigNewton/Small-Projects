###Estimates mean long-term gain from different gambling strategies
Strategies:
<ol>
<li>Custom: Basically Martingale with a delayed progressive betting strategy.</li>
<li>Martingale</li>
<li>Fixed: Bet the same amount every time</li>
</ol>

##Feed Forward Cat and Potato Identifier
###Based on what I learned in a Coursera course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/
###Classifies synthetic data into cat and potatos.
I designed the architecture and used numpy for calculating the partial derivatives for backpropagation, matrix multiplication, and other operations.
The training and test data is all synthetic, but I did base it on Russet potato and cat statistics I found online.

##Feed Forward from Scratch
###Based on what I learned from a Youtube series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzWaow1Rvho&list=PLxt59R_fWVzT9bDxA76AHm3ig0Gg9S3So
###Calculates the weighted average of input nodes' values.
Designed and calculated partial derivatives by extrapolating from the videos.
Uses lots and lots of for loops.
