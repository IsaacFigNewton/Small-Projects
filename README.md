<h2>Feed Forward Cat and Potato Identifier</h2>
<h3>Based on what I learned in <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/">this Coursera course.</a></h3>
<h3>Classifies synthetic data into cat and potatoes.</h3>
<p>I designed the architecture and used numpy for calculating the partial derivatives for backpropagation, matrix multiplication, and other operations.</p>
<p>The training and test data is all synthetic, but I did base it on Russet potato and cat statistics I found online.</p>

<h2>Feed Forward from Scratch</h2>
<h3>Based on what I learned from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzWaow1Rvho&list=PLxt59R_fWVzT9bDxA76AHm3ig0Gg9S3So">this Youtube series.</a></h3>
<h3>Calculates the weighted average of input nodes' values.</h3>
<p>Designed and calculated partial derivatives by extrapolating from the videos.</p>
<p>Uses lots and lots of for loops.</p>
